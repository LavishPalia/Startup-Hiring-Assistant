          We check each candidate's <strong>expected salary</strong> â€” lower
          salaries score better for budget-friendliness.
        </li>
        <li>
          We look at their <strong>past job titles</strong> to see if they match
          the role (e.g. "Full Stack Developer").
        </li>
        <li>
          We scan their <strong>skills</strong> for keywords relevant to the
          job.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each of these signals is <strong>scaled fairly</strong> so they can be
          compared apples-to-apples.
        </li>
        <li>
          We combine them into a single score using the weights you set above.
        </li>
        <li>
          Candidates are ranked by score. If two are close, the system prefers
          the one with a lower salary or more skills.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, we pick the top person for each role. With the diversity
          option on, we try to spread hires across different locations when
          possible.

        You can adjust the sliders above to give more importance to experience,
        skills, or budget. The weights always add up to 100%.
